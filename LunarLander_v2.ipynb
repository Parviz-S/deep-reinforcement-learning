        "\n",
        "- Reinforcement Learning is a **computational approach to learning from actions**. We build an agent that learns from the environment by **interacting with it through trial and error** and receiving rewards (negative or positive) as feedback.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The goal of any RL agent is to **maximize its expected cumulative reward** (also called expected return) because RL is based on the _reward hypothesis_, which is that all goals can be described as the maximization of an expected cumulative reward.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The RL process is a **loop that outputs a sequence of state, action, reward, and next state**.\n",
        "\n",
        "- To calculate the expected cumulative reward (expected return), **we discount the rewards**: the rewards that come sooner (at the beginning of the game) are more probable to happen since they are more predictable than the long-term future reward.\n",
        "\n",
        "- To solve an RL problem, you want to **find an optimal policy**; the policy is the \"brain\" of your AI that will tell us what action to take given a state. The optimal one is the one that gives you the actions that max the expected return.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are **two** ways to find your optimal policy:\n",
        "\n",
        "- By **training your policy directly**: policy-based methods.\n",
        "- By **training a value function** that tells us the expected return the agent will get at each state and use this function to define our policy: value-based methods.\n",
        "\n",
